## Introduction

Horta is a Grasshopper component library for the generation and use of the *Space Groups* in architectural computation. Horta employs the International Notation System (aka the Hermann-Mauguin System) to define the Space Groups.

## Counters

### **Multi-Counter** 
Generates a counter which traverses an entire Data Tree. 

### **Surface Spacer** 
pre-Alpha experimental. Distributes points or frames -approximately- evenly across a base surface. The more entities to distribute, the more accurate.

## Input Components

### **Lattice System Selector** 
Right click on the input to select from the possible Lattice Systems.

### **Centering Type Selector** 
Right click on the input to select from the possible Centerings of the Unit Cell.

### **Allowable Systems** 
This component is under construction.

## Generator Components

### **Parallelepiped Lattice Generator** 
A component for the generation of the lattice points to be used in constructing Unit Cells and Cell Topology.

### **Parallelepiped Bounding Box Generator** 
A component for the generation of a parallelepiped which bounds the same extents as an entire Lattice generated by the Parallelepiped Lattice Generator. Enter the same values as you would for the Lattice to generate this solid.

### **Lattice-Bounding Box Generator** 
Generates a parallelepiped which bounds the extents of a Lattice generated by the Parallelepiped Lattice Generator.

### **Unit Cell Generator** 
Generates a single Unit Cell based on the properties of the Lattice.

### **Lattice Cell Constructor** 
A component for the generation of Cell Topology across the entire Lattice.

## Symmetry Components

### **Position Composer** 
Compose an individual position of the International (Hermann-Mauguin) Symbol for a Symmetry Group. Use with the Symbol Composer Component. Note that not all Crystal Systems / Bravais Lattices accept the same Positions or number of Positions. Concise reference forthcoming. Until then, refer to a crystallography text for more information.

### **Symbol Composer** 
Composes the full Symmetry Group Symbol and the number (1-230) of the corresponding Space Group. All symbols follow the long form of International (aka Hermann-Mauguin) Notation.

### **Symmetry Operations** 
Processes Symmetry Operations on Geometry, based on the Hermann-Mauguin (aka International) Symbol. This component is VERY MUCH still under development. Use at your own risk!!!

## Numbers Components

### **Alphabetical Character Generator** 
Generates a list of alphabetical characters in English for piece marking purposes.

### **Binary Decode** 
Convert any binary number to a positive integer.

### **Binary Encode** 
Convert any positive integer to binary.

### **Clamp Number** 
Clamps and number within a Domain. If the number is below the lower value of the domain it returns the lowest value of the domain. If the number is above the highest value of the domain it returns that number.

### **Domain from Interval, Origin, and Parameter** 
Returns a Domain of a specified Interval Width, from a specified Number, as measured by a Normalized Parameter

### **Element Range** 
A component which returns even intervals between n elements. The regular Range component in Grasshopper returns n steps, which produces an extra element. Use this component to avoid having to subtract 1 from your list length n to get the proper number of steps.

### **Min Max and Bounds** 
Returns the Bounds of a list of values like the Grasshopper native 'Bounds' component. However it also returns the Minimum and Maximum values separately. Just a small helper component whose only use is to avoid the need to decompose the Domain of the output of the Bounds.

### **Modular Quotient and Remainder** 
Returns the Quotient and Remainder of a division operation.

### **Prime Decomposition** 
A component for the decomposition of any positive integer into a list of its prime factors.

### **Span of 1d Domain** 
Returns the total Span of a One-Dimensional Domain. Has the option of being signed or absolute.

### **Triangular Wave Value Generator** 
Takes domain and a specified number of steps between, and repeats a progression from lower to upper and back a specified number of times.

### Known Issues

1.  The Trigonal and Hexagonal Lattice Generator is not yet functional and thus is not included. These systems are not currently able to be generated by this program.

2.  Other Crystal Systems may have bugs in the generation of their geometries. Use at your own risk, and please report any observed
    bugs to the developer.

3.  Glide Plane Symmetries have not been implemented.

4.  For debugging purposes, the logic used to limit the input to the Symbol Composer to parseable symbols is currently disabled as of 07/13/2024. Unexpected results may occur.

5.  The current Minimal Working Example file - 240206_Minimal_Working_Example.gh - currently requires the Rhino Polyhedron Component Library for Grasshopper to generate the test geometries. However, any geometry can be inserted here. This Library is not needed for proper function of the Horta Component Library.

6.  Some input and output symbols which are intended to be connected may not match in symbol / letter description. Reference the Minimal Working Example file for examples of the proper wire connections.

7.  There is currently no component for the generation of Space Groups by number. This component is forthcoming.

8.  The Parallelepiped Lattice Generator will generate the Lattice Basis for Bravais Lattices that are not based on the AB Plane. However, the program does not currently use these to alter the order or location of subsequent geometries. All operations are currently oriented only to the Basis Plane AB. If your application requires a different basis, be aware of this and use whatever translation tools / techniques you need. You have been warned.

9.  The Symmetry Operations component may produce many redundant copies of input geometries. Save often, use at your own risk.

10. This list is only of **known** issues. Please report any issues to the developer promptly for debugging and repair.
